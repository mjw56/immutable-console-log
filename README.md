# immutable-console-log

A convenience wrapper for ```console.log``` when you just want to directly log [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) collections to the console.

This is just a wrapper around the pre-existing ```console.log```, so you can use it as you normally would.

## Use it in your project

```bash
$ npm i -S immutable-console-log
```

```js
import 'immutable-console-log';
```
